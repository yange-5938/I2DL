# I2DL Exercise

I2DL is [Introduction to Deep Learning (I2DL)(IN2346)](https://niessner.github.io/I2DL/) course from Prof. Matthias Nie√üner.

This repo contains my answers of the i2dl course exercises.

There's two version of kernels and its different packages due to the exercises mixed from different Semester.


### TODO

Exercise 5, implementation exercises done, but there's theoretical exericses need to revisit.

Exercise 6, need to try the model to have more than 48% of accuracy.

Exercise 7, tryout pytorch, tensorboard, and pytorch-lighting. Build Classifier of Exercise 6 with pytorch.

#### Not Clear

- calculating backpass of sigmoid, the Hadamard product is used instead of dot product, why?
